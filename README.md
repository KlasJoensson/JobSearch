Job Search

The idea is to make a web app that rates a job advert by searching for keywords in the text.
I plan to add a connection to the API of Swedish Arbetsf√∂rmedlingen to search for ads.
And also have some text box for copy paste texts from other sources and one for an URL to the an interesting ad to be investigating. 

Installation

The web app is run on Apache Tomcat 8 and Java 9.
